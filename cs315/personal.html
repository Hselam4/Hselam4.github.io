    <h2>My Personal Profile</h2>
    <p>
        I was born and raised in <b>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</b>I graduated in Bachelor with Civil Engineering in July 2017, and after
        that I have worked <b>on road designs and consultant</b> with a Japan owned company outside of the city, during my time there
        as a junior consultant, part of my task was designing road structures and making sure the construction is based on the designs
        we did. In order to to the design parts we used different software in order to make our job easy and for the designs to work. 
        we also used those software to solve some problems with our projects. Even though I have only worked for a year I have learned 
        so much both from my work and the Internet.
    </p>
    
        While i was working there, I started to read and watch more videos how those computer and IT world works and how technology is
        important and makes everything easy. I wanted to study and be able to learn more about software development.
        While I was trying to apply to different colleges abroad, me and my whole family won a Diversity Visa lottery to the US.
        This was a huge success and a big opportunity for me and my family with a lot of open opportunity in <b>USA</b>. After I moved 
        to <b>California,</b> I took a four weeks online course and then joined miu to pursue my dream to study software development. <b> 
        Now Iâ€™m MSD student at <a href="https://www.miu.edu/">MIU</a>. </b> Besides my interest to become a software developer, I also like to 
        read, play volleyball and spent time with my family</b>.
